# About Loftwah Pizza

We ferment our dough for **72 hours**, use stone-ground flour, and finish every pie
with a custom infused oil. This demo project mirrors how our real kitchen operates:
everything is modular, and ingredients are composed into experiences.

## What Makes The App Interesting

- **React Router** keeps the experience snappy – no page reloads when you bounce between the menu and this page.
- **MDX** lets us ship rich content like this with Markdown readability *and* React interactivity.
- **TypeScript** makes the menu data trustworthy. If someone forgets to add a price, the build fails before a customer ever sees it.

> Hot tip: Try toggling filters on the menu. The cart total updates immediately thanks to Zustand state and a sprinkle of React Query caching.

## Team Values

1. Transparency – the full recipe is in the repository.
2. Iteration – every improvement builds from the CDN version upward.
3. Hospitality – light mode is banned, because ambience matters.

Need more nerdery? Pop back to the menu and inspect the developer console; each component is cleanly named to make debugging painless.
